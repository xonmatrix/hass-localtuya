# Overview

LocalTuya is an [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/){target="_blank"} integration that enables you to control your Tuya-based smart devices directly within your local network. 


!!! info "LocalTuya is a Hub "
    `LocalTuya` serves as a hub. After setup, whether using `cloud` or `no cloud`, you can manage your devices through the entry configuration UI in `hub configuration`.
    <!-- `Each Tuya account can be add on it's own` -->


!!! info "Cloud API"
    LocalTuya uses the cloud solely to obtain device data and pre-fill the required fields for you.

    It offers many features to simplify device setup.

    `LocalTuya` can be used independently of the cloud.
